    It was time to get my head around how CSS Grids work, they have been out in the wild now for a few years and [browser support has hit 94%](https://caniuse.com/css-grid). 
    The first issues i had observed is a lot of the example concentrate of syntax rather than workflow, and while the 
    syntax is relatively simple the workflow is not. I suppose it very difficult to tackle workflow in a tutorial, and really you just need to roll up your 
    sleves and get craking with a practical application. So here a some pros and cons;

    ## Pros

    - Firstly, indications are that CSS Grids are brilliant and what we've need since we stopped using table layout in terms of layou consistancy.
